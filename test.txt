Sam Gavis-HughsonPHI 203Final PaperDeterminism is the idea that everything in the universe follows a specific path and that the entire past and future were determined by the original state of the universe.  There are two ideas that conflict with determinism: free will and randomness, as both of these would make it impossible that there be only one set path for the universe to follow.  In the following paper, I will present arguments against both of these before combining these arguments to show how they prove a completely deterministic universe.  To do so I will employ certain laws of physics in addition to my philosophical arguments, so it is necessary to accept these laws as generally true in order to accept the overall argument.  I also make the assumption that these laws have remained constant for the entire history of the universe as we know it (e.g. starting moments after the big bang).	First, I am going to present arguments against the existence of free will.  In Paul Holbach’s The Illusion of Free Will   he makes the bold statement that “man’s life is a line that nature commands him to describe…without his ever being able to swerve from it, even for an instant” (451).  He proceeds to present the following argument for why this must be true.  Imagine the following example: you have a man who is dying of thirst.  This man has a strong desire for water to drink, but this is not because of his own free will.  Instead, this desire is caused by his inherent desire for self-preservation.  This is an obvious example of causation because the man’s thirst directly causes his desire to drink water and so if he comes across water, his drinking will not be a result of his own free will but rather a desire caused by his body’s need for water.  	Although this causation is obvious, that one event that the man could not control caused his actions, Holbach argues that this causation remains true in all circumstances, many where it is seemingly non-existent, where the person seems to have made a decision with no basis on anything concrete.  He argues that a man’s actions are “always the necessary consequence of his temperament, of the received ideas, and of he notions…which he has formed to himself of happiness” (453). Holbach’s argument is that every human action is caused by outside forces and is therefore not controlled by the mind.  He makes the clear argument that although there is often not an obvious correlation between outside events and peoples’ actions, this is simply because there are so many factors at play that it is often hard to see an obvious connection.  To do so you would have to take into account every experience as well as temperament and personal values.  Holbach also makes an interesting address to the idea of choice.  Imagine that I tell you to raise either of your hands.  This appears to be your choice and you believe yourself to have had the will to make whichever choice you want.  However, you subconsciously are being forced to make a certain decision.  I am challenging the idea that you yourself have free will, so you choose whatever you feel will prove that you have free will.  In this case, because of your subconscious motives, you will be forced into making a specific choice.  Therefore, free will is an illusion.  Because you cannot see all of the forces at play and you go through the process of considering your decision, it seems as though you have control, but no matter what you think, these thoughts are all based somewhere in your experiences and preferences. This rightly leads Holbach to the conclusion that people cannot have free will.	The primary concern with this argument is the idea that thoughts can originate from within the mind, not being caused by any external factors.  In a previous paper, I discuss how all thoughts in the human mind are the product of the senses, in that they necessarily arise from influences outside of the mind itself  .  To briefly summarize, I demonstrate how the progression of knowledge through time is a clear indicator that it is impossible for people to have completely original thought because everything that anyone has every discovered is simply the synthesis of things that are already known.  As Isaac Newton said, “if I have seen a little further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants”  .  I describe how, true to Newton’s words, his discovery of calculus was nothing more than the combination of his observations and all of the math that came before, so although his discovery seemed revolutionary, it was really just a knew combination of prior knowledge.  My conclusion in this paper is that there cannot be original ideas that stem solely from the mind itself.  Combined with Holbach’s argument, these two arguments conclusively disprove free will.   If all actions are caused by our state of mind and there is no way for ideas to originate in our mind, then all of our actions must be caused by the world around us, therefore discounting the possibility of humans having the free will to make their own decisions. Now that I have presented an argument to disprove the notion of free will, I am going to argue that randomness cannot possibly exist, thereby supporting my deterministic argument.  What is randomness?  For our purposes, I will split the definition of randomness into two parts: true randomness and apparent randomness.  An apparently random occurrence is an occurrence for which we cannot predict the outcome.  This would generally be the result of not knowing all of the necessary information to determine the outcome.  Contrarily, true randomness would be when an occurrence is unpredictable even when all relevant information is known.  In this section, I am going to differentiate between true and apparent randomness and show how true randomness cannot exist.  First, we will consider the case of a computer generating random numbers, a perfect example of apparent randomness.  A computer uses many circuits and can use these circuits to perform calculations.  This is the only thing it can do.  Therefore, if I ask a computer to give me a random number, it will use certain algorithm to generate pseudo-random numbers.  This is a prescribed set of steps where the computer will take a starting value from some memory location and through a set of computations generate numbers that appear to be random.  Depending on the algorithm used, these numbers may be more or less random, but with enough testing it is possible to come up with a pseudo-random number generator that is functionally the equivalent of a random number generator, because based on all tests that we have to test random numbers, these pseudo-random number sets would also pass    .  Therefore, a pseudo-random number generator is a perfect example of something that demonstrates apparent randomness but is not truly random.  Given the algorithm, we would be able to predict the exact sequence of numbers, proving that given all of the necessary information, we could predict the outcome and this is not, consequently, truly random.	Let us take a coin toss, which is generally considered to be random, with one study showing the variation of 245 out of 20,000    .  Statistically speaking, this shows that a coin toss is apparently completely random.  Despite the general acceptance of a coin toss being random, this process actually produces predictable, and therefore non-random, results.  For example, scientists created an automatic coin flipper which repeatedly flipped a coin in a consistent manner, and given the uniformity of the results (i.e. consistently heads or consistently tails) , it is obvious that the flipping of the coin itself does very little to introduce any sort of randomness.  Therefore, the apparent randomness in a coin flip must be introduced by the imprecision of human actions.  When I flip a coin, the precise velocity and rotation of the coin will vary each time, producing results that do not seem to follow any sort of pattern.  I would then say that since I do not know what the outcome will be, this coin toss is apparently random.  However, this apparent randomness stems from my own ignorance.  If I knew the velocity of the coin, the density of the air, the way in which the coin would interact with the surface on which it lands, and every other fact there is to know about the coin and the way it interacts with the world around it, I could predict with complete accuracy which way it is going to land.  Therefore, this contains an apparent sense of randomness given the inaccuracy of my actions and my own inability to predict the result simply through watching the coin flip due to lack of information.  Given that this action is predictable given the proper information is proof that a given flip is not truly random since, given all of the information, I could predict the outcome.	Whether or not you choose to believe that a coin flip is apparently random, this concept can be extrapolated to something that is generally agreed on to be random: Brownian Motion.  Brownian motion is the apparently random motion of particles suspended in a fluid, which is caused by the interactions with the individual molecules.  Now imagine that I take a look at a single particle and I want to predict its path.  If I could zoom into the atomic level and see the molecules and everything surrounding it, I could theoretically calculate all of the forces on that individual particle.  For example, I know the charge of an electron and a proton, and if I could see how many of each there were and their exact positions and velocities, I could calculate where they will end up at the next moment in time.  Now this is not possible.  As Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle states, it is impossible to know both the position and velocity of an electron because you alter one by observing the other.  This last part is crucial.  He does not say that the electron does not have a specific position and velocity, he simply says that you cannot discover one without affecting the other, and therefore cannot know both.  The implication here is that, although Brownian Motion demonstrates apparent randomness, if you were to have all of the necessary information, Brownian Motion would be predictable, and is therefore not truly random.  Brownian Motion is a good generalized example of how anything that takes place on the atomic level is not truly random despite its apparent randomness, because it shows how factors like the velocity and position of electrons that prevent humans from being able to predict the outcome do not affect the outcome in a universal sense, and therefore are consistent with determinism.	Now that I have shown that both free will and true randomness cannot exist, I am going to combine these into clear demonstration of determinism.  Imagine back to the very beginning of time.  Depending on your beliefs the universe could be a soup of atoms, an infinitely small and infinitely dense ball of mass, or an empty space waiting for God to fill it with matter.  Regardless of your choice, skip ahead to the point where matter first comes into existence with atoms that are made of protons, neutrons, and electrons.  We will focus on a snapshot of this precise moment in time.  If it were possible, I would look at every single atom and every subatomic particle and see its exact position and velocity.  From here, I know the properties of each of these particles.  I can calculate what will happen if a proton and an electron get too close to one another, or if two electrons collide.  If I was able to gain all of this information and had a computer powerful enough to process it, then I would be able to calculate these same properties for each particle at the next moment in time.  Now I repeat this process indefinitely and eventually, if I am accurate with my calculations, I end up at this exact moment in time, sitting here and typing these exact words on my computer.	As proven in the previous sections, this outcome is set.  The way that the world aligns itself before humans and before conscious thought is easy to see.  Since true randomness does not exist, seemingly random events like radioactive decay and Brownian motion have set outcomes.  The apparent randomness of these events is what causes the universe to take on such a unique appearance and is what could lead to the appearance of non-determinism.  However, since these occurrences must play out in a set manner, the entire formation of the universe could only take place in one possible way base on the original orientation of all of its matter.	If we accept that the universe could only have formed in one possible way, it appears, according to the argument presented in the first section, that the decisions that people have made and will continue to make through all of history were set at the very beginning of time, along with everything else.  Since our thoughts and decisions are based on the world around us, the fact that the world around us must be a specific way necessitates that our thoughts must also be predetermined.	Before I conclude, I would like to address an issue stemming from my argument against true randomness that I have failed to address before this point.  The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that we cannot know the position and velocity of an electron at any given time.  On top of that, the computers that we are able to create have a limited capacity, and there are problems where due to the scale of the input, it would be impossible to solve on a computer (e.g. the time it would take would be more than the length of the universe).  Due to these two constraints, it would be completely impossible for us to predict all of the interactions between particles.  Even given a universe composed of one atom, we would not be able to predict the future of that universe, as we could not know all of the properties of all of that single particle.  This issue gets at the heart of what determinism is.  Determinism is the idea that the universe will follow a specific course.  Although certain explanations that I provided get at the idea of actually predicting the future, the fact that this cannot be done in no way disproves my argument.  I simply use this as a device by which it could become apparent that determinism exists, because it shows that all of the information necessary to predict the future exists.  Since the inaccessibility of this information does not disprove its existence, it is apparent that, given this information and the necessary processing power, we would be able to predict the future, and the prediction of the future would only be possible if the it is set in stone.
